# Welcome

I am Dara, and this is my Odin Project Repository. As I go through the Odin Project, I will put all of my projects here for organizational purposes. Feel free to browse through my Odin projects, or my [personal github profile](https://github.com/prince-of-maroc).


## What is the Odin Project?

The Odin Project is an [open-source](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) curriculum for learning full-stack web development. It has a hands-off approach that encourages learners to fill in the gaps with practice and research. As the curriculum progresses, there are many projects. With only a vague set of guiding prompts, it is up to the learner to build the application from scratch. It is these projects that I will be storing here.
